## 'Mister Grid' enables setting up a user interface to an LED light grid


Important files:

- app.js - runs most of the main code... handles incoming HTTP requests and acts accordingly

when app.js calls <code>res.render('grid', params)</code>, express will use the view engine (ejs) to render the file 'grid.ejs', with the parameters specified. 

- grid.ejs - the webpage layout... uses embedded javascript to access javascript functionality within HTML. 
Syntax: 
	<% code %> specifies the use of javascript code, such as for loops
	<%= var %> specifies the insertion of a javascript variable into the HTML




API endpoints:

    /GET/	 redirects to grid
    /GET/grid	 displays the grid of buttons as well as the image
    /GET/press	 processes a button press
    	- query
	  x: the x coordinate of the tile button
	  y: the y coordinate of the tile button
	  val: the current value of the tile



Image display:
      there is middleware in app.js that specifies your public directory
      Embedded javascript makes it very easy to insert the image source into html
